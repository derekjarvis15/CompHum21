,,,v,,History of the Commission 
,"It is necessary to a right understanding of the objects of the  Commission that we should briefly explain why it was initiated  by the National Council of Public Morals. The Council had  published in June 1916 the report of the National Birth-Rate  Commission giving the results of its three years' inquiry into the  causes and effects of the declining birth-rate, and had presented  it to the Government. The Rt. Hon. W. H. Long, M.P., President  of the Local Government Board, in receiving the Commission  said — ",,v,,"It is necessary to a right understanding of the objects of the  Commission that we should briefly explain why it was initiated  by the National Council of Public Morals.

The last  speaker referred to the financial cost of this work. I venture to  say, although I do not for a moment doubt that the burden in  this respect was a heavy one, that the good which you have  done by your inquiries and by your report cannot by any possi-  bility be measured in terms of money.

,"Amongst the various branches of the Council's work it has for  some years been deeply concerned with the influence of the  cinematograph, especially upon young people, with the possi-  bilities of its development and with its adaptation to national  educational purposes. The Bishop of Birmingham, the President  of the Council, took a leading part, together with the Rev. F. B.  Meyer, D.D., the Chairman of its Executive in the first Cine-  matograph Congress at the Olympia in 1913.

,"It is well that we should again recall the principles, as set out  in its reports, upon which the Council conducts its operations.  We have striven in and out of season to remove the emphasis  from rescue to prevention and from prevention to construction.  We have sought, not to come out into the streets and with clamour-  ing to strike the evil on the head, for the effect of this policy has  been, whilst appearing to clear the evil away in one place, to  drive it to take deeper root underground and to spring up again  with tenfold more vigour elsewhere. We have rather set ourselves  to undermine the evil, to get at the deeper causes in character,  low ideals, ignorance, and false prudery. And in so doing we have  expressly desired to win the sympathy of the men and women  who are writing our books, are catering for public amusement,  edit or own our newspapers, and have under their control  the vast machinery for instantly and effectively reaching millions  of people. We have seen the folly of making enemies of those  who control these great and potent agencies by indiscriminate  denunciation, by standing upon a lofty pedestal and playing the  superior part, censoring, denouncing, imprisoning. The law  must be enforced and constantly pressed up to the level of public  opinion, and we have all along taken our share in doing that work.  But our deepest concern has been to help all those whose enter-  prises are calculated, when run on a low level, to foster the merely  animal nature, especially of the young, to raise the whole tone and  character of their industries, as well as to get rid of the obviously  indecent thing, which is by no means the greatest danger we  have to fear.

,"Much more than this was required of us. We were invited to  meet representatives of the whole trade, and to discuss frankly  the best means of getting rid of whatever evil elements existed,  and of meeting the demands of the best public opinion for a higher-  class programme, for more suitable exhibitions for children, for  the suppression of certain evils which had thrown themselves on  the cinema halls as they had on other places, and which the war  had accentuated, and also for the establishment of a censorship  which would give legitimate freedom for the proper development  of the cinematograph whilst rigorously cutting out undesirable  films. We met the trade, and fully and openly discussed these  proposals. We carefully studied the whole subject and situation,  discussing them with Government and educational authorities,  and we met many times to confer upon them. We saw that we  all ought to know much more about the character, extent, and  the influences of the cinematograph. There was clearly a strong  case for thorough and impartial inquiry. This the leaders of  the trade saw and heartily welcomed as the best means of obtaining  the results we all desire. But the Council resolved not to propose  the matter themselves, but to wait until the various sections of  the trade should themselves ask us to establish such an inquiry.

,"While no one to-day would venture the suggestion, so com-  monly made a few years back, that the popularity of the cinema  is no more than ephemeral, it may be doubted if there is even  yet sufficient realisation of the strong and permanent grip which  the picture palace has taken upon the people of this country.  All other forms of recreation appeal only to a section of the  community, but the lure of the pictures is universal; while the  cheapness and accessibility of the houses make it possible for the  masses to indulge in this enjoyment almost to an unlimited  extent. In the course of our inquiry we have been much impressed  by the evidence brought before us that moving pictures are having  a profound influence upon the mental and moral outlook of millions  of our young people — an influence the more subtle in that it is  subconsciously exercised — and we leave our labours with the deep  conviction that no social problem of the day demands more  earnest attention. The cinema, under wise guidance, may be  made a powerful influence for good ; if neglected, if its abuse is  unchecked, its potentialities for evil are manifold.

,"In accordance with the terms of reference from The National  Council of Public Morals, the Cinema Commission of Inquiry began  its work on January 8, 1917, and finished July 9, 1917. It has  examined forty-three witnesses, representing all the different  interests involved in the inquiry, as well as a number of boys  and girls. In addition to the weekly sittings for hearing witnesses,  the Commission has held a number of other sittings at a private  theatre for the inspection of the films complained of. It also  appointed Committees to visit various cinema halls, and, as the  evidence shows, caused many other inquiries to be made on its  behalf amongst Chief Constables, Clerks to the Justices of the  Peace, and among School and Y.M.C.A. workers. It has received  numerous communications from the general public in almost  every part of the United Kingdom, and as far as possible has  given attention to every complaint made. It is to be regretted  that a few of those who have most prominently identified them-  selves with the attacks on the picture house, which were the  immediate occasion of the inquiry, have refused to give evidence  so that their charges might have been thoroughly investigated,  and their validity or otherwise have been established. While  the representatives of the trade have offered every facility, the  inquiry has been absolutely independent and impartial; and we,  the members of the Commission signing this Report, submit it  with the conclusions and recommendations we have reached, in  full confidence that it will receive the unprejudiced consideration  which we believe that by its character it deserves, and which in  the moral, social, educational and religious interests of the nation  it is desirable should be given to it.

The charge has been brought against the picture house  that the darkness encourages indecency, especially where there  are boxes, though this is the case in a very few houses ; ^ and  that the promenade or the standing room at the back of the  building, where such exists, affords opportunities for improper  conduct. 2 In 1915 there were only two prosecutions for in-  decency in connection with the cinema brought under the notice  of the London Branch of the Exhibitors' Association .^ A pro-  bation officer of twenty-five years' experience stated that he had  known of only one indecent assault in a cinema,* and another  that during four years one charge of indecent assault had been  made, and that there were far more charges of indecency taking  place in open spaces.^ A social worker in East London stated  that she had "" seen the boys behave in a very nasty manner  towards the girls,"" and gave a specific instance of a gross act  she had herself observed.^ Sir Robert Wallace reported that a  number of cases of indecent assault had come before him, and  that there was reason to believe that many women, shrinking  from the publicity involved, did not make the complaint they  might have made. He had had a number of letters from fathers  of girls teUing of horrible things, for which the standing room at  the back had afforded opportunity.

When asked if at that time there were no  cinemas, the witness added : "" I do not remember any. In a  number of cases I also find that the mothers go out to work,  and I have known cases where families of nine and ten children  have been left entirely to the care of a girl of twelve or thirteen  years of age, and even, in some cases, these children are left at  night."" 3 There are other economic and social changes due to the  war, which must be recognised as factors in the increase of juvenile  crime.* There has really been an increase of juvenile crime, but  not so great as the numbers of delinquents would indicate ; for  on the one hand children are now brought before the courts for  offences which cannot be called crimes, and on the other a greater  number of persons is now engaged in keeping the young in the  right way, sometimes with too great zeal. *' There has been a  tendency in recent years to increase the variety of offences with  which children may be charged. For instance, children are now  charged with wandering, with being without proper guardian-  ship, with being beyond proper control. Our streets are now  more rigidly supervised than ever before.

The main purpose  of the industry is to provide a healthy form of amusement and  recreation of such a nature as to prove attractive to a large number  of people, and thus ensure a profitable return for the vast amount  of capital invested in the trade. The cinema appeals to a much  larger public than any other form of public entertainment by  reason of its continuous programme and the low prices charged  for admission, ranging under normal conditions from Id. to 25. 6d.,  and varying with the position of the cinema theatre. A large  mass of the poorer population has thus for the first time within  its reach an opportunity of attending places of amusement, which  was previously impossible in consequence of the comparatively  high prices charged for admission.

They also complain that  the interest which has been created by exciting films, in which  through the excessive peptonisation of the material presented  there is a consequent absence of much necessity for mental effort,  renders the child a more difficult subject for instruction in which  concentration and hard work are the necessary conditions of  successful teaching. There was such general agreement on these  points among educational experts, many of whom were by no  means hostile to the cinema, that we must regard such complaints  as being well founded.

,"Although, as already stated, the cinema is to be regarded  primarily as a means of amusement and recreation, many praise-  worthy attempts have been made by some producers of films to  deal with natural phenomena from the educational standpoint,  and films have been prepared in whi5h the educational interest  is predominant.

Childhood is pre-emin-  ently the time of vision. The educational importance of concrete  visual illustration is now an admitted principle. Many schools  have their optical lantern. The addition of motion to the picture  trebles the amount of realism thus gained, and the amount of  interest is, at the same time, enormously enhanced. "
,"Since the eye provides a natural channel for the acquisition  of knowledge during childhood, it follows that information thus  gained can be acquired without undue mental strain. The strain  and fatigue that are reported by the children are physical in origin  and can be eliminated by the enforcement of simple hygienic  requirements.

,"Necessity of Preparation for Cinema Work. — Undoubtedly infor-  mation is more effectively gained if two channels and two media  are employed — eye and ear, pictures and words. The moving and  pictorial representation should supplement, or be supplemented  by, description or explanation in words, if not at the time, then  before or after the visit. In the children's essays the items most  frequently reproduced, and the points most clearly and accurately  expounded, are those where the information has been learned first  from a picture and then from the teacher or book, or first from  the school and then from the cinema. The vivid, concrete imagery  derived from the picture palace at once illuminates and can be  expressed in the nomenclature and formulae derived from lessons  or from print.

The particular pictures at present shown presuppose  merely an exercise of the mind which is comparatively feeble.

,"Training in Observation. — Children who habitually frequent the  cinema undoubtedly develop a remarkable power of observation,  at least for incidents depicted on the screen. This is repeatedly  demonstrated by comparing the remarks made by such children  either during the performance or in an essay subsequently com-  posed, with the remarks of children, equal or superior in intelli-  gence, who are visiting the cinema almost for the first time. The  occasional spectator commonly finds that the changes and move-  ments take place too quickly to be grasped, or occur when his  eyes are directed to a different part of the screen, or when his  attention is busy with his thoughts and reflections instead of with  his retinal impressions. But with half a dozen visits even he can  trace within himself the gradual development of a capacity for  rapid observation.

This point appears and reappears with  great persistence in the essays, debates and in the replies of the  children themselves. For the child the cinema means primarily  recreation, play, not work.

,"Summary  According to these investigations there appear to be great  possibilities for the cinema in education. The dangers, both  physical and psychological, have already been reduced. Those  that survive seem chiefly a consequence of the picture palace as at  present arranged and the moving picture as at present produced.  Both are universally acknowledged to be imperfect. Superior  lighting, seating, ventilation, control of the admission of children,  and, above all, a higher standard in the production of films con-  sidered as works of art, should largely remove the .dangers that  remain. Any mental damage done is thus incidental to the cinema  and not essential, not an indissoluble characteristic of the moving  picture as a specific form of art. The moving picture is intensely  exciting, intensely realistic, and can cover an amazingly wide  field of information. But these very characteristics, which may  make it such a powerful instrument for evil, guarantee its future  possibilities as a potent instrument of culture.

Four examiners were appointed by Mr. Redford, and the work  was begun on January 1, 1913. Entire independence and im-  partiality were assured to, and have been maintained by the  Board of Censors. As the scheme was voluntary, it was intended  to issue a Certificate to the Exhibitors who showed only censored  films, but the proposal proved ineffective.

Two certificates are issued, one ""U""  for films to be shown to any audience, and one "" A "" for films  suitable for adults only.

Picture performances  can be run by an operator and assistant with just a few ushers  to seat the people properly, whereas in the other case, you have  the whole of the players, which, perhaps, is a matter of ten to a  hundred people.

,"English picture makers have always been short of capital.  For some reason the English investor has regarded this industry  as far too precarious to command his serious attention, and  opportunity after opportunity has slipped by and fallen to the  credit of our rivals.

It is almost an impossibihty  for an English picture maker to obtain such facilities for his  work from railroad and steamship companies as in America are  freely and gladly given.

The Biograph Company had bigger pictures,  and their pictures were very expensive, and they could not  long hold their own against the smaller and cheaper pictures  of the Edison gauge. The Biograph Company, being on its last  legs, apparently made this offer to the importers in America.,  that they would protect them against Edison, oppose the trust,  and grant them an entry into the American market. We paid  to the Biograph Company — I speak now of the European com-  panies generally — the same rate of royalty that the other firms  were paying Edison, until the time came that this Biograph  Company joined with Edison and refused to have anything more  to do with us. By various means, and I think it is only fair to  say by the greater insight of the financial people of America, it  gained a large financial leading over the European market, and  certainly over the English people. The English people had been  hampered by the want of capital from the beginning, but when  the Biograph Company joined hands with Edison and formed  this big trust, it immediately stopped the import of films from  England — in fact, from Europe generally — and that hampered,  naturally, the EngHsh producers very much indeed.

We paid  to the Biograph Company — I speak now of the European com-  panies generally — the same rate of royalty that the other firms  were paying Edison, until the time came that this Biograph  Company joined with Edison and refused to have anything more  to do with us. By various means, and I think it is only fair to  say by the greater insight of the financial people of America, it  gained a large financial leading over the European market, and  certainly over the English people. The English people had been  hampered by the want of capital from the beginning, but when  the Biograph Company joined hands with Edison and formed  this big trust, it immediately stopped the import of films from  England — in fact, from Europe generally — and that hampered,  naturally, the EngHsh producers very much indeed.

,"At present, owing to the war and other causes, there appears to  be a decrease in the quantity of film subjects turned out in the  States, while at the same time, signs are not wanting that both  in quality and in excellence all round the film output is vastly  improved. The major proportion of the films shown at present  in British picture houses are American, and we can realise from this  fact alone that American manufacturers have every reason to raise  the level of their productions. Practically 75 to 80 per cent, of  American motion picture negatives are produced in Southern  California, an ideal country for motion pictures on account of  the brilliance of its sunshine and the permanence of its climate.  Here are turned out at least 125 reels a week of 70 different  brands.

,"There have been a great many arguments advanced as to the  reason of the universal predominance of the American picture.  These include the advantages derived from greater investments  of capital, more favourable climatic conditions, a greater field for  distribution in the United States with its, say, 20,000 picture  houses as against some 5000 in the British Isles, greater sumptu-  ousness in production, better casting and characterisation, more  varied scenery and such general attention to minute details which  the disposal of very large means would bring about.

The question of eyestrain to the children was especially inves-  tigated. Now, eyestrain was in the main due to causes arising  from defects in the earlier machine which have now been remedied.  The average modern apparatus projects a perfect and a rock- "

However, in time there grew to be a  strong agitation throughout the different States on the censorship  question, and many laws were passed to regulate it. A number of  States have their own censor board, the diversity of their different  rulings resulting in much confusion, for the simple reason that as  motion pictures are put out to-day, the various States of the Union  are supplied with fresh sets of titles to suit the local board of  censors' likes and dislikes. With a number of different persons  airing their views and opinions upon these subjects, a picture,  about which there is the slightest question, is liable to become so  mutilated by the time it^is finally passed, that its own father would  not recognise it. I cannot speak too strongly in favour of film  pictures being censored. No manufacturer in his senses would  invest his money in a picture which was indecent or immoral. As  a matter of fact, such pictures to-day cannot be said to exist.  But the real crux of censorship, in my opinion, lies in discriminat-  ing as to the effect a picture will have upon all kinds of audiences,  old and young, and whether the methods of presentation employed  are such as not to offend the canons of good taste, nor to present  life from such an angle as to glorify crime or wrong-doing and to  make probity ridiculous.

,"179. Mr. Lamert. The first question I wish to ask is with re-  gard to the lighting of the cinemas . Sir William Barrett has referred  to the fact that in giving lectures he had projected, I think he  said, lantern slides on to the screen, and the room was sufficiently  light to enable his students to take notes. He argued that  similar lighting would be possible in cinema halls. Is the analogy  complete ? — No.' The gentleman who asked the questions prob-  ably alluded to microscopic lantern slides, which, as a rule, are  very largely made on clear glass; that is to say, they are not  films, and the designs are more or less on a light background. In  the majority of cases these slides measure three inches across,  whereas our films are less than one inch across ; that is to say, they  are nine times as large. Then the sHdes are projected on a screen  of, say, six, eight, or ten feet across, whereas we project our films  on screens thirty to thirty-five feet across, so that a very much  higher degree of magnification is needed. Then, again, you must  bear in mind that our hall is generally full of smoke, whereas a  lecture hall very seldom is. ",,74,CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS,"179. Mr. Lamert.

,"The human eye has a wonderful power of adapting itself to  varying conditions of illumination. But to one elKect it is well-  nigh incapable of adapting itself. That is the effect of a single  light in a dark place. The light may be but a feeble light, but  if the space in which it is exhibited be dark this feeble light will  be relatively intense, and therefore irritating to the eyes. These  conditions are found exemplified in the highest degree in all  optical lantern exhibitions. To enhance the effect of the show  the room is made as dark as possible, the light of the lantern as  bright as possible, and the transparency as strong as possible.  The light from the lantern is projected on to the whitest possible  screen, and therefrom it is reflected directly into the eyes of the  observer. All these necessary conditions of the show are the  worst possible conditions for the eyes; they all tend to produce  the maximum of fatigue. The effects of glare are further inten-  sified in the cinematograph show by the programme screen shown  between the films. These slides are often far too brilliant in the  contrast between the white print and the dark background.  Particularly bad are the impromptu slides, made by scratching  the writing on a screen of coloured gelatine. These slides should  be prepared so that the contrast between the print and the back-  ground is the smallest necessary for visibility.

,"It will be asked : What evidence is there that children's eyes  suffer from the picture shows ? The evidence is of such a nature  that it cannot be presented by figures and percentages. For-  tunately the effects are temporary, and unless the indulgence be  frequent it is easily recovered from. The effects that have been  set out are those which have been ascertained from personal  observation, and confirmed by the observation of children of  intelligent types who have been attending the shows. Indeed,  as was stated at the opening, the effects are experienced by  adults ; the child only suffers from this in a higher degree because  of its frailer organisation. It may be asked : Is there any  evidence of permanent defect arising out of attendance at the  show? It is difficult to answer this question. But there is a  recent observation which I am inclined to think has some bear-  ing on the point. The examination of, the case papers of a large  number of school children who have been referred to eye clinics  on account of a failure to pass the standard vision tests at the  schools, shows that there is an increasing number of children  who on examination at the clinic are found to have nothing the  matter with them. At the school they did not pass the test;  at the first examination at the clinic they did not pass the test ;  when their eyes were examined nothing amiss was to be found,  their eyes objectively were normal, or so nearly normal as to be  quite capable of passing the standard test ; at a later subjective  examination they did pass the test satisfactorily. There may  be several conditions to account for these occurrences, but by far  the most likely cause is a condition of fatigue in the children, so  that at the time of the test they were incapable of putting out  sufficient energy, either ocular or mental, to read the standard  types. In some cases I have ascertained that children of this  sort were habitually at the picture shows, and it is possible the  increasing attendance at these shows may be associated with the  increase in the number of children who fail at the vision tests  without objective cause. If the normal-eyed children suffer, it  is certain that the result will be more serious in those with defec-  tive eyes, and possibly lead to permanent aggravation of those  defects. ",,100,CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS,"It will be asked : What evidence is there that children's eyes  suffer from the picture shows ? The evidence is of such a nature  that it cannot be presented by figures and percentages. For-  tunately the effects are temporary, and unless the indulgence be  frequent it is easily recovered from. The effects that have been  set out are those which have been ascertained from personal  observation, and confirmed by the observation of children of  intelligent types who have been attending the shows.

,"In dealing with indecorum of dress, the examiners are met with  the objection that on the stage a licence has been permitted which  makes it very difficult for them to enforce so strict a standard as  seems to them desirable, but they insist upon deletion when the  dress appears to be meant to be indecent or suggestive.

,"74. Do you think there is any advantage, or any different  effect produced by the cinema shown to a boy from Eton and a boy  from the elementary school? — Well, supposing they are two  youngsters of the same age and attend the same pictures and the  same number of pictures. The Eton boy would start with this  advantage : he would probably know more to begin with. More  pictures would appeal to his mind and give him useful information.  Suppose we take the case of timbering or lumbering. He might  have read a novel on the subject, and if he has, the pictures would  be instructive to him and not the least harmful. In the case of  the elementary school child, assuming that the picture comes  before him, long before he has time to know anything about it  it passes and another one comes. I am anxious to emphasise  this, that the effect upon that child is very bad, even though the  pictures are perfectly good. It is bad in more ways than one.  I hold that the English boy, as compared with the American  and the French boy, requires to be slowly taught. That is to  say, the mind works slowly and he is not so advanced at the age  of sixteen as the American boy is. Well, what happens? The  child either gives up the effort to keep up with the pictures, in  which case he merely becomes befogged or confused, or if he has  an active brain and an inquiring mind he does his utmost to keep  up with them when he has not the knowledge to do so. And  there I am convinced in the case of young children that you run  a very serious danger, because there is not the intellectual effort  that an adult can make. If the child's mind is over-active the  effort is really greater than it ought to be called upon to make,  especially if you have had one picture rapidly succeeded by  another one. Amongst the children going to cinema shows you  have a good many with active brains, but they are largely ignorant  of the matters shown them.

,"%% 38. The Chairman. You wish to deal solely with the ques-  tion of the cinema from the point of view of the police court  and the incidents arising there from the suggestive nature of the  films on young minds, and as to the indecencies of the pictures  themselves, or the opportunity which darkness affords ? — I think  it would be much better to confine myself strictly to that which  comes within my own experience. I would like to say, in the  first place, in regard to the topic that has often been raised as  to the indecency of pictures themselves, that I have quite satisfied  myself from the general information I have received — and I have  been trying in every direction /to find out — ^that indecency does  not exist in any general sense in the pictures themselves. The  pictures may be vulgar, they may not conform, perhaps, to the  standard of taste that some would desire, but they are not in-  decent, and I do not think that charge can be made against those  who are responsible for the pictures. That is the result of the  inquiries I have made in regard to the matter. In regard to  indecency arising out of the circumstances under which the  pictures have to be given, there is perhaps more to be said. As  you know, cases of indecent assault, if they are contested, are  not dealt with by the police magistrates summarily; they are  sent for trial to the Sessions, and in that way they come before  me, and a considerable number of cases of that kind have had  to be tried in the last year or two. I was very much afraid from  the nature of the evidence given in connection with these cases  that there were a great number of cases which never came for  trial because the girls or women who are the object of the assault  do not care for the publicity which attends the trial. They  shrink from having their names connected in any way with a  thing of that kind. Every one knows that to be mixed up in a  police court at all, even if you are a complainant, is a disagreeable  thing, and the conclusion which I arrive at after hearing several  of these cases is that there are many more of them than the  number of cases which are actually tried. In regard to that, I  suppose pictures are best shown in total darkness, but in Bir-  mingham, I understand, they have half-lights or something of  that kind. If it is possible to show the pictures in such a way  as to give interest to those who see them, and at the same time  to have sufficient light, that would largely prevent what has  been going on in London. The first suggestion I make would be  that it would be desirable to adopt some such system as has  been adopted in Birmingham. The other point in connection  with this question is this : I think the whole system of having  a promenade is most undesirable, allowing the standing together  promiscuously of people at the back of the hall.

There is the mystery  which darkness in itself produces, and then the condition of mind  to which they are reduced by the atmosphere and by the effect  of constantly going there to see the pictures, for, you see, I am  dealing simply with pictures suggestive of crime.

Do you distinguish between any of the kinds of crime,  such as the '* crook "" crime, the murders ; while there are some  adventurous crimes ? — It is the adventurous crime that has come  chiefly before me. The other type of crime is repulsive. I will  deal with what I call the bold crime. Now if an adventurous,  bold boy with an active mind and body sees a man climbing up  a rope to get into a window, and then balancing himself on the  window-sill and using a knife — w^ell, what is the effect ? There  is the natural desire to reproduce largely, if it is a bold thing  and of that type of crime I am referring to. Even if the crime  is that of the ""artful dodger"" — you know what I mean: the  sleight-of-hand movement, quickness — they like to try that.  Now, I will mention to you two cases. I tried a boy of about  seventeen years of age, who was sent for trial to the Sessions.  He had committed six burglaries, he had stolen watches and  smajll jewellery, not very valuable, but all amounting in the  aggregate to sonde £80 or £90. Well, he had no defence, because  he was at last caught red-handed. Now, I am not putting before  you his account of the cause, because it may be that a boy, a quick  boy, knows the best way of giving an excuse, but I am dealing  with the evidence of the police. As you know, in our courts,  before sentencing any one, we insist on the fullest investigation  by the police as to the antecedents of the boy and the history of  the crime as far as possible. Now this boy in the first place had  the highest character.

,"had had money entrusted to him and had never lost a penny,  and here he had committed six burglaries. The police then said  that the remarkable thing about it was this : that of this £80  to £90 worth of burglary he had never realised one pennyworth.  When he was taken at the end of the sixth attempt he told the  police where they would find the things, and every article from  the first burglary to the last was carefully stored up there together,  and they were all recovered. It was simply adventure. Then  I asked the police the history of the boy, and they told me they  had investigated the matter. He had got into this habit — it  seems to be a habit — of going almost daily to these picture palaces.  He had been going day by day, steadily and regularly, and seeing  how things of this kind were done, and he had an adventurous  desire to try to realise himself that which he had seen on the  stage. That is one illustration, and you can draw your own  conclusions from it. The other case to which I referred was a  case of two young men seventeen or eighteen years of age.  They went into a shop in the south of London ; they were armed  with a stage pistol, a sort of weapon which is said to be very  dangerous if employed at close quarters. They went into this  shop; the shopkeeper was there by himself, and they both  presented their pistols at his head, and called upon him there  and then either to hand over what money he had or take the  consequences. Well, the timid man — I suppose we are all,  perhaps, more or less timid in things or circumstances like this —  proceeded to hand over his money, but they were captured  almost immediately. Now these two boys had been members  of the Boys' Brigade. The particular branch of the Brigade was  watched over very carefully by two young Admiralty clerks,  who were very careful and keenly interested in the boys. And  what was the character they gave of these two ? They were the  two best boys they had ever known ; not a thing against them in  any shape or form. In their employment and in their daily life  they gave them the highest character, and all that could be  gathered from the evidence was that they had seen something  on the stage — "" Your money or your life "" — and they thought it  a good opportunity. Well, the authorities looked into this  matter, and they could not send the boys to Borstal, because  the Prison Commissioners would not ha\^e them because of their  previous good characters. The alternative was to send them to  Dartmoor, which was then a convict prison, because there was a  sort of modified Borstal system carried on there. Now, I was  in communication with the Home Office on the matter, and I  said I would do nothing of the kind. I said I was quite satisfied  from the inquiries the police made that they were not bad charac-  ters, and that it was the spirit of adventure w^hich alone actuated  them, and that they were acting on that which they had seen,  so I bound them over for judgment, and those boys are following  their occupations to-day properly.

,"29. Would you like an adult attendant to be provided to keep  order in regard to the children's entertainments ? — I think that is  a very important point. One of my real complaints is that great  harm may be done, and I believe is done, by the lack of proper  supervision. In regard to this matter, when the houses were built  and the films prepared and the general arrangements made,  children were forgotten, and had to fit in under the conditions  provided for adults. Now not only at the entrance is there a  great deal of supervision required ; but the lack of proper super-  vision when the children are in their seats is, in my opinion,  detrimental to them. I will take one point, the question of  seating. Children are made to sit in a way detrimental both to  their health and their morals. I can give a case, for instance,  where something like this occurred that, say 300 children, have  had to sit upon seats prepared for 200 adults. The seats are  tip-up seats with no arms, so that the children can be pushed  together, and that is bad and ought not to be allowed. Then again,  the children are allowed to mix together, and there is no arrange-  ment in some of the halls where children at the back can see over  the children in front. All these things are bad for the children,  and I feel in this matter that the physical side is of great  importance. ",,168,CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS,"29.

I should think the mothers  send their children purposely, not to get rid of them, but for love  of them, to give them a pleasant hour or two hours ; and then  they are more amenable to home discipline.

I think it is wrong to exclude  the sun's rays from the structures. Many medical officers of  health have informed me that the absence of the sun's rays is a  thing they complain of. "

,"5. Why should not the British manufacturer have the com-  plete hold over the British Isles ? — The American has enormous  sales in his own country, and he has the sales in his hands, and  possibly the sales in this country. You must take into considera-  tion that there are 30,000 cinemas in the United States, as com-  pared with 4000, approximately, here. The result is that the  American can spend much more money in, excess of the English-  man, with the result that the American production is generally  more magnificent.

,"10. Now as to the renter ? — The renter has two branches of his  business, the open market and the exclusive renting. The renter  goes to the viewing-rooms, and is the selector of the open market  subjects. We will say there are fifty open market renters. Well,  these fifty renters will have viewers viewing films in London, and  in addition to this the trade papers and exhibitors will have a  man to view. These men, having viewed the films, will hand  in their reports, and in due course orders are sent in for the films.  I might say that at the present moment orders are being placed  for April 23rd. Many renters are purchasing copies of the open  market subjects. The other type of renter is the exclusive  renter, who goes to the producer of exclusive films and, having  selected something likely to appeal to the exhibitor, he goes to  the owner and purchases it entirely, and therefore he is the  only man who owns that subject and has the right to it. Each  exhibitor then goes to him to negotiate for the hire of that  subject. Usually the manufacturer holds rights for the whole  world, and he disposes of those rights to people in the different  coimtries. ",,196,CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS,"10.

,"So far as films depicting burglaries, robberies and other in-  fringements of the law are concerned, I have this to say — where a  good home influence is wanting I think quite possibly such films  may have a pernicious effect on the young. It must be borne in  mind that children who are looking at these pictures are at the  impressionable period. Their home life does not provide for the  inculcation of the cardinal virtues, and in a large number of cases  they are children of unhealthy body and mind. In such cases  films of this type may give a wrong impetus to the imagination  of the child. Even in these films the moral lesson is always satis-  factory. It is always demonstrated that vice brings its own  penalty in suffering both for body and mind. Undoubtedly this  spectacle of inevitable retribution must tend to offset the fictitious  glamour of wrong-doing.

,"In my opinion the closing of the picture houses, or their pro-  hibition to children, would have most unbeneficial results. In  many cases the cinemas are the only form of healthy recreation  available, and this is particularly the case during the long winter  months. The children in question have neither the taste nor the  facilities for indulging in any sport, and if the cinemas were  closed to them, so far from the condition of the streets being  improved, I am convinced there would be an immediate and  immense increase in hooliganism, shop-lifting and similar street  misdemeanours. Fifteen years ago street hooligan gangs were a  real menace and problem. Now such gangs are quite unknown  in my district.

,"I think it is obvious that the cinemas are a strong counter-  attraction to the public- houses, and, in my experience, the attitude  of the average parent to these shows has been very friendly indeed.  If there is any serious antagonism on the part of religious people  to the picture shows, I should say it arises from the violent objec-  tion of such people to the Sunday opening of places of amusement  and recreation. So far as the official opposition of the churches  is concerned, I should say this is due to an entire misapprehension  of the position. In many cases there is an entire lack of under-  standing as to the practical conditions in which the poor live.

,"The point has often been made that attendance at the cinemas  makes it increasingly difficult to secure the attendance of the child  at Sunday schools, night schools, guilds and similar organisations  for the welfare of the young. I do not think that the attendance  at these places would be materially increased by restricting the  cinema. Night schools do not attract the boy of fourteen who is  physically tired by a heavy day's work. So far as social guilds  are concerned, these, in my opinion, are not generally very attrac-  tive concerns, and the various clubs for children do not retain the  interest of boys and girls for long.

Night schools do not attract the boy of fourteen who is  physically tired by a heavy day's work. So far as social guilds  are concerned, these, in my opinion, are not generally very attrac-  tive concerns, and the various clubs for children do not retain the  interest of boys and girls for long.

A confederate comes in and puts his hand under the  case and so goes off with the ring. Well, the story ends quite  pleasantly, because these people in the club get their 5000 dollars,  and you see the burglar and the girl end up their life in the country.  It all ends very well.

The head master in this school has done much to deter boys  from going. In another school the percentage of boys and girls  attending cinemas during April was 16 per cent.

Educational films such as those dealing with plant life are useless  unless explained by a teacher or some competent person and taken  as part of the school curriculum.

,"On the question of special children's performances I wish to  say that a specially selected programme is not at present a com-  mercial proposition.

Those who do attend are nearly always  accompanied by their parents, and are seldom seen in the theatres  after 8 p.m. The number of children attending cinemas increases  as the prices of admission decrease. In other words, the problem  of the child and the cinema belongs chiefly to the poor- class dis-  tricts. Until housing and home life conditions are improved, and  until something is done to provide other equally attractive forms  of wholesome entertainment for children, it does not seem to me  to be wise unduly to restrict attendance at the cinemas. The  probable result would be that children would simply roam the  streets, with their attendant evils and temptations.

,"The most striking result that emerges from the investigation  is, that the older children have a remarkable power of giving good  accounts of films they have only seen once.

,,,276,CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS,MINUTES OF EVIDENCE  Dr. Kimmins. Examined. 
Dr. Kimmins,"Dr. Kimmins : I think the simplest way would be for me to  elaborate the evidence, and give you a few extracts from essays  showing you the mind of the child with regard to the cinema.  I would urge you not to attach much importance to the results  from the girls' central school, because I only had 184 papers sent  in, which is not a sufficient number from which to draw a very  definite conclusion. In many of the children's essays they simply  refer to the last performance or the one before that. I have  thoroughly analysed the papers and there are several points which  come out very clearly. I have noticed that the girls take a greater  interest in domestic drama and fairy stories. Quite a large number  of fairy stories have been filmed, and they have been described in  great detail. As regards the comics they are very much more  popular with the boys than the girls, and when one analyses  every age one finds that in the upper standards the boys are less  attracted by the comics than the boys in the lower standards. The  boys are much keener on serial films than the girls, but this may be  explained by the fact that the boys have more opportunities of  attending the cinema than the girls. The interest in war films  is very great and varies from school to school. Then, again,  the boys take a keener interest in the crook films than the girls,  while love films are more popular with the girls than the boys ; and  it is very noticeable that in the schools in very well-to-do districts  the purely love film is more popular than in the poorer districts.  To carry on this investigation I selected six schools from poor  districts and six schools from good districts, in order to get a great  difference in the home surroundings. One point comes out in the  analyses of the papers of the girls' central school ; and that is, that  there is an increased interest at twelve and thirteen years of age  in films about cowboys and adventure. I will quote some ex-  tracts from essays as to why some of the children do not go to  cinemas.

,"In accepting the appointment of Organising Secretary to the  Union, two considerations governed my decision. Speaking as  one who has been closely connected with the working class and  trade union movement for upwards of twenty-five years, I am  profoundly convinced that the cinema exhibitions have given to  the workers a form of entertainment which in the main constitutes  a real pleasure and respite from the drab surroundings of many.  No one conversant with the actual working class conditions can  fail to be struck with the monotony of most of our modern indus-  tries. Specialisation, the mechanical habit produced by consistent  attention to one operation or one part of a complex production,  has created a new problem amongst most of our workers engaged  upon machine productions. These are denied the mental activity  and the personal pleasure of a former generation of mechanics and  artisans who were the creators of a complete article. For those  who are the victims of this change the cinema provides a mental  stimulus which in hours of bodily rest gives knowledge and  pleasure without fatigue. For this reason, speaking for my class,  who are overwhelmingly the greatest proportion of patrons, I am  convinced that the question of control cannot be left to those,  however high and lofty their motives may be, who condemn upon  hearsay, or make incidents into general charges. Nor is it in the  interest of national betterment that a source of harmless amuse-  ment should be threatened with destruqtion, thereby reducing  tens of thousands to a choice of the street or the public- houses.

In  the inquiry carried out by the Home Office Departmental Com-  mittee on Lighting in Factories and Workshops, of which I am  a member, a large number of observations and measurements  were made in typical factories, and were found most valuable  in showing that recommendations made on theoretical grounds  were justifiable in practice.

In order to meet the views of authorities as regards pro-  priety, and to diminish the objectionable contrast between the  brightness of screen and surroundings, and also as a measure  of safety, a small amount of permanent general artificial illumina-  tion, maintained while the display is in progress, appears desirable.

,"I agree in general with Mr. Ross's views. Since the inauguration of the  cinema houses in this burgh, a number of years ago, I have only received  two complaints regarding the conducting of these entertainments. The  first complaint applied to the film that was being shown, but on visiting the  place personally, the occupier most willingly showed me the pictures on the  screen, and I saw no cause for complaint. The other was an attempted  indecent assault, owing to the darkness of the place, but on my making a  representation to the occupiers of these houses, a considerable improvement  was made in the lighting, and since then no complaint has reached me.

",,358,CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS,"I agree in general with Mr. Ross's views. Since the inauguration of the  cinema houses in this burgh, a number of years ago, I have only received  two complaints regarding the conducting of these entertainments. The  first complaint applied to the film that was being shown, but on visiting the  place personally, the occupier most willingly showed me the pictures on the  screen, and I saw no cause for complaint. The other was an attempted  indecent assault, owing to the darkness of the place, but on my making a  representation to the occupiers of these houses, a considerable improvement  was made in the lighting, and since then no complaint has reached me.

,"I cannot endorse Mr. Ross's views altogether. That the picture houses  are popular goes without saying, but that the entertainments provided are  educative is true only in a limited sense, indeed, the pictures which are most  popular are not educative at all. Whilst there are pictures that come under  this category, my experience is that they are very lew. If there were more  educative pictures, say of natural history studies, foreign travel, and pictures  that would give an idea of the extent of the British Empire, and its resources  and responsibilities, instead of pictures based upon novels, which exploit the  sex problems, wild and impossible adventures, .and so-called comic pictures,  it would be far better. I agree that the cinema attracts many who would  otherwise resort to public -houses, but do not think it has had the slightest  influence on the habitual drinker.

Much more could be accom-  plished by the Education Authorities in producing to the notice of children  films of historical and geographical interest as well as travel and other interest-  ing subjects. Facts are more easily impressed upon a child's memory by  object lessons, such as pictures would supply, than the older and effete form  of lectures, maps, etc., which up to a certain age make little or no impression.  In consequence these subjects being uninteresting in the form presented to  children, render the knowledge of them imperfect in adult life. Geometry,  mensuration and other subjects, as zoology, geology, physiology, bacteriology,  and even languages, could be similarly treated.

,"In Sheffield some cases of crime committed by youths have certainly been  traceable to the lessons taught in picture houses. One, for example, quite  recently where three small boys were convicted of tampering with the mail  vans from which many letters had been extracted (the majority were for-  tunately recovered), the modus operandi was conceived from the halls and by  the reading of adventurous novels. Undoubtedly picture palaces form an  attractive outlet for money either stolen direct or realised by children on  articles which they have stolen, and many such cases are disclosed in the  prosecution of children for offences of felony, but it is only on very rare  occasions that it can be positively said that the felony was committed with the  express intention of providing means for admission to cinema houses.

,"I quite agree with Mr. Ross's evidence in the main. I certainly think, and  can prove, that they have formed a counter-attraction to public-houses,  inasmuch as many former visitors to public-houses may now be seen fre-  quently attending the various picture houses. I have also had it reported  to me of one man having stated that he was much better in health and in  pocket by attending the picture houses on Saturday afternoons and evenings  instead of spending his time drinking pints of beer in public-houses, as hitherto.  As regards their influence for evil upon the people, I must say that pictures  showing how crimes are committed are to my mind calculated to have a  serious influence upon children shorn of parental control, and those of criminal  tendencies; or even upon grown-up people of weak minds and criminal  tendencies. Such pictures, that frequently end in the culprit escaping,  following a demonstration of the criminal's cleverness in carrying out the  crime so as to baulk the police, must assuredly influence persons of the type  before -mentioned to try to emulate the hero of the play. I am also of opinion  that pictures suggestive of immorality should not be permitted. Those are  the pictures that find favour with youths and girls of immoral tendencies,  and there can be no gainsaying the fact that they later form subjects of  comment between such youths and girls, either in the workshop or in the  street, that must inevitably lead to acts of immorality in many cases —  possibly unknown to the police. We have to remember that littles lead  to far greater evils, and that evils resulting from immoral influences are usually  practised in secrecy ; therefore, the police cannot very well be in a position  to say that such .pictures have or have not had some evil influence upon  certain individuals in the audience.

,"As regards (3) it is probably the most serious of the difficulties. There  is no doubt whatever as to the imitative character of crime among young  persons, and pictures of thrilling crimes are more than likely to have a de-  moralising effect on young persons of twelve or thirteen years of age up to,  say, sixteen or seventeen years of age. Censorship in the case of these films  is far more difficult than in the case of films likely to be an inducement to  immorality. The difficulty can only be met by censorship; but I do not  see how a mere representation (for instance) of a burglary can be banned  altogether; and it is not easy to suggest any satisfactory method of dealing  with the question. In addition to the above-mentioned objections raised  against picture houses, I understand that it is alleged that boys commit  thefts for the purpose of obtaining funds to spend on this form of pleasure.  The same objection might be made against lollypops. In favour of picture  palaces it may be said that they provide a cheap and to a great extent in-  structive form of popular entertainment ; also that they are to a considerable  extent a counter-attraction to public-houses, although in this connection  the closing at present of public -houses in the afternoon must be borne in  mind in estimating the extent to which this is the case.
