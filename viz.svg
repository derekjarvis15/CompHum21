I have repeatedly  had testimony from town majors and men in charge of the  discipline of the various places, that the opening of one of these  cinemas in a town has meant an immediate diminution, amount-  ing in some cases to 50 per cent., in drunkenness and crime. In  one town at the northern end of our line we opened a cinema;  the * drunks ' there had been at a hundred a night, and the town  major told me that the night we opened they went down to  sixteen, and they have not gone up to twenty-five. In another  town, not twenty miles from that, the town major said it meant  an immediate diminution of crime to the extent of 50 per cent.  In our large reinforcement camps, where the men are sometimes  for three weeks or a month with nothing to do, it is the greatest  boon in the world for them to get in and have a good real laugh,  and spend a pleasant hour without the drink." ^ : 1</title></rect><rect x="0" y="201.52808988763945" height="0.038202247191009064" width="5" fill="black"><title>Dr. Lyttelton, formerly Head Master of Eton, says — : 1</title></rect><rect x="0" y="206.56629213483046" height="0.038202247191009064" width="5" fill="black"><title>Mr. J.

He also says : "I have taken a deep interest in this aspect of  children's welfare and education, and have endeavoured to pre-  serve an open mind in consideringthe effects of the films on children.  When in Newcastle -on-Tyne I inaugurated a trial scheme where-  by children in elementary schools were taken in drafts to a certain  school hall at which films were shown which had been chgsen  by a committee of educational experts. In Manchester I have  frequently encouraged teachers to send drafts of children during  school hours to cinema houses showing approved films." * : 1</title></rect><rect x="0" y="216.64269662921248" height="0.038202247191009064" width="5" fill="black"><title>Mr. Percival Sharp, Director of Education in Newcastle-  on-Tyne, in referring to the cinema as an instrument of education,  says : " The subjects in respect of which claims have been made  for the educational value of the cinema are history, geography  and nature study. One recognises the value of good pictures,  whether kinetic or static, as an aid to the formation of mental  pictures of scenes geographical or historical; but to claim more  than that would be, in my judgment, confession of a very inadequate  concept of the true meaning of the study of either subject. A  much more insidious claim can be made for the cinema as an  educational aid to nature study. No doubt many very interesting  processes can be brought to the intellectual door, but I feel  strongly that the effective study of science must be based on  personal observations, comparisons, measurements and de-  ductions." .^ : 1</title></rect><rect x="0" y="221.6808988764035" height="0.038202247191009064" width="5" fill="black"><title>Mr. John Kay, formerly President of the National Association  of Head Teachers, is of opinion that " There does not appear  to be a large place for the cinema in primary school work.

As an in-  teresting and attractive aid, purely illustrative, to the teaching  of a small group of subjects — industrial geography, travel, con-  temporary history, natural history and the like — there is a small  field for it. Used in conjunction with lecture and letterpress it  can give much colour to fact and terminology, but the cost would  have to be small to justify its employment." ^ : 1</title></rect><rect x="0" y="226.7191011235945" height="0.038202247191009064" width="5" fill="black"><title>Mr. J. W. BuNN, member of the Executive of the National  Union of Teachers, states : " I do not think that there is any  ^educational value in the films worth mentioning at present. Some  houses, in deference to the clamour for improving the mind,  put in films showing manufacturing processes and natural phe-  inomena, but I believe these only bore the audience and are  tolerated in silence until the real entertainment commences  again. I think that in poor neighbourhoods where the children  need more change and variety in school work than among the  I well-to-do, it would not be a bad plan to have a cinematograph  ^lesson once a week. It could be done by arranging for children  [from three or four schools to go for an hour to a suitable  cinerna, and the education authority could pay proprietors a  penny per head, exactly as they do now for visits to the baths.  I should arrange for the programme to be selected by the  teachers, and for one of the teachers to explain the films in a  few suitable words as the exhibition proceeded. The film pro-  prietors have hundreds of beautiful films illustrating mountain,  river and forest scenery, the manufacture of common articles,  etc., which they are ready to loan at any time, and there will be  no difficulty in getting the managers of local halls to admit school  children during school hours at a penny each." ^ : 1</title></rect><rect x="0" y="231.7573033707855" height="0.038202247191009064" width="5" fill="black"><title>Mr. Grant Ramsay, Principal of the Institute of Hygiene,  who has given much attention to the educational value of the  cinema, says — : 1</title></rect><rect x="0" y="236.79550561797652" height="0.038202247191009064" width="5" fill="black"><title>Mr. A.

Well, from that point the Americans have  realised the possibilities of this cinematograph from the com-  mercial point of view more clearly than the English people have.  There has not been that support of the English manufacturers ;  it has been hard to obtain capital to develop the picture industry  in the way it should be developed. The money that was available  for the cinematograph progress was put into the theatres for many  years, and it cannot be denied that for many years the theatres of  this country were infinitely better than the theatres in America. : 1</title></rect><rect x="0" y="267.0247191011227" height="0.03820224719106591" width="5" fill="black"><title>Mr. Lamert.

I have repeatedly  had testimony from town majors and men in charge of the  discipline of the various places, that the opening of one of these  cinemas in a town has meant an immediate diminution, amount-  ing in some cases to 50 per cent., in drunkenness and crime. In  one town at the northern end of our line we opened a cinema;  the * drunks ' there had been at a hundred a night, and the town  major told me that the night we opened they went down to  sixteen, and they have not gone up to twenty-five. In another  town, not twenty miles from that, the town major said it meant  an immediate diminution of crime to the extent of 50 per cent.  In our large reinforcement camps, where the men are sometimes  for three weeks or a month with nothing to do, it is the greatest  boon in the world for them to get in and have a good real laugh,  and spend a pleasant hour without the drink." ^  → RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL WORK: 1</title></g><g style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"><path d="M5,201.54719101123496C490,201.54719101123496,490,195.05730337078643,975,195.05730337078643" stroke="rgb(190, 36, 73)" stroke-width="1"/><title>Dr. Lyttelton, formerly Head Master of Eton, says —  → RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL WORK: 1</title></g><g style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"><path d="M5,445.6292134831469C490,445.6292134831469,490,237.8786516853932,975,237.8786516853932" stroke="rgb(158, 1, 66)" stroke-width="5.501123595505618"/><title> → EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS: 144</title></g><g style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"><path d="M5,206.58539325842597C490,206.58539325842597,490,234.87977528089885,975,234.87977528089885" stroke="rgb(254, 221, 141)" stroke-width="1"/><title>Mr. J.

He maintains  in this connection that children are less apt to form wrong ideas  from moving pictures than from the verbal or written descriptions.  He also says : "I have taken a deep interest in this aspect of  children's welfare and education, and have endeavoured to pre-  serve an open mind in consideringthe effects of the films on children.  When in Newcastle -on-Tyne I inaugurated a trial scheme where-  by children in elementary schools were taken in drafts to a certain  school hall at which films were shown which had been chgsen  by a committee of educational experts. In Manchester I have  frequently encouraged teachers to send drafts of children during  school hours to cinema houses showing approved films." *  → EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS: 1</title></g><g style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"><path d="M5,216.66179775280798C490,216.66179775280798,490,234.95617977528087,975,234.95617977528087" stroke="rgb(119, 198, 166)" stroke-width="1"/><title>Mr. Percival Sharp, Director of Education in Newcastle-  on-Tyne, in referring to the cinema as an instrument of education,  says : " The subjects in respect of which claims have been made  for the educational value of the cinema are history, geography  and nature study. One recognises the value of good pictures,  whether kinetic or static, as an aid to the formation of mental  pictures of scenes geographical or historical; but to claim more  than that would be, in my judgment, confession of a very inadequate  concept of the true meaning of the study of either subject. A  much more insidious claim can be made for the cinema as an  educational aid to nature study. No doubt many very interesting  processes can be brought to the intellectual door, but I feel  strongly that the effective study of science must be based on  personal observations, comparisons, measurements and de-  ductions." .^  → EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS: 1</title></g><g style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"><path d="M5,221.699999999999C490,221.699999999999,490,234.99438202247188,975,234.99438202247188" stroke="rgb(246, 250, 174)" stroke-width="1"/><title>Mr. John Kay, formerly President of the National Association  of Head Teachers, is of opinion that " There does not appear  to be a large place for the cinema in primary school work. In  the essentials of instruction it can be of no service. As an in-  teresting and attractive aid, purely illustrative, to the teaching  of a small group of subjects — industrial geography, travel, con-  temporary history, natural history and the like — there is a small  field for it.

W. BuNN, member of the Executive of the National  Union of Teachers, states : " I do not think that there is any  ^educational value in the films worth mentioning at present. Some  houses, in deference to the clamour for improving the mind,  put in films showing manufacturing processes and natural phe-  inomena, but I believe these only bore the audience and are  tolerated in silence until the real entertainment commences  again. I think that in poor neighbourhoods where the children  need more change and variety in school work than among the  I well-to-do, it would not be a bad plan to have a cinematograph  ^lesson once a week. It could be done by arranging for children  [from three or four schools to go for an hour to a suitable  cinerna, and the education authority could pay proprietors a  penny per head, exactly as they do now for visits to the baths.  I should arrange for the programme to be selected by the  teachers, and for one of the teachers to explain the films in a  few suitable words as the exhibition proceeded. The film pro-  prietors have hundreds of beautiful films illustrating mountain,  river and forest scenery, the manufacture of common articles,  etc., which they are ready to loan at any time, and there will be  no difficulty in getting the managers of local halls to admit school  children during school hours at a penny each." ^  → EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS: 1</title></g><g style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"><path d="M5,231.776404494381C490,231.776404494381,490,235.0707865168539,975,235.0707865168539" stroke="rgb(252, 175, 101)" stroke-width="1"/><title>Mr. Grant Ramsay, Principal of the Institute of Hygiene,  who has given much attention to the educational value of the  cinema, says —  → EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS: 1</title></g><g style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"><path d="M5,236.81460674157202C490,236.81460674157202,490,235.1089887640449,975,235.1089887640449" stroke="rgb(221, 75, 74)" stroke-width="1"/><title>Mr. A.

I have repeatedly  had testimony from town majors and men in charge of the  discipline of the various places, that the opening of one of these  cinemas in a town has meant an immediate diminution, amount-  ing in some cases to 50 per cent., in drunkenness and crime. In  one town at the northern end of our line we opened a cinema;  the * drunks ' there had been at a hundred a night, and the town  major told me that the night we opened they went down to  sixteen, and they have not gone up to twenty-five. In another  town, not twenty miles from that, the town major said it meant  an immediate diminution of crime to the extent of 50 per cent.  In our large reinforcement camps, where the men are sometimes  for three weeks or a month with nothing to do, it is the greatest  boon in the world for them to get in and have a good real laugh,  and spend a pleasant hour without the drink." ^ </tspan></text><text x="9" y="201.54719101123496" text-anchor="start"><tspan alignment-baseline="middle" x="9" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; fill: black; font-weight: bold;">Dr. Lyttelton, formerly Head Master of Eton, says — </tspan></text><text x="9" y="206.58539325842597" text-anchor="start"><tspan alignment-baseline="middle" x="9" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; fill: black; font-weight: bold;">Mr. J.

He maintains  in this connection that children are less apt to form wrong ideas  from moving pictures than from the verbal or written descriptions.  He also says : "I have taken a deep interest in this aspect of  children's welfare and education, and have endeavoured to pre-  serve an open mind in consideringthe effects of the films on children.  When in Newcastle -on-Tyne I inaugurated a trial scheme where-  by children in elementary schools were taken in drafts to a certain  school hall at which films were shown which had been chgsen  by a committee of educational experts. In Manchester I have  frequently encouraged teachers to send drafts of children during  school hours to cinema houses showing approved films." * </tspan></text><text x="9" y="216.66179775280798" text-anchor="start"><tspan alignment-baseline="middle" x="9" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; fill: black; font-weight: bold;">Mr. Percival Sharp, Director of Education in Newcastle-  on-Tyne, in referring to the cinema as an instrument of education,  says : " The subjects in respect of which claims have been made  for the educational value of the cinema are history, geography  and nature study. One recognises the value of good pictures,  whether kinetic or static, as an aid to the formation of mental  pictures of scenes geographical or historical; but to claim more  than that would be, in my judgment, confession of a very inadequate  concept of the true meaning of the study of either subject. A  much more insidious claim can be made for the cinema as an  educational aid to nature study. No doubt many very interesting  processes can be brought to the intellectual door, but I feel  strongly that the effective study of science must be based on  personal observations, comparisons, measurements and de-  ductions." .^ </tspan></text><text x="9" y="221.699999999999" text-anchor="start"><tspan alignment-baseline="middle" x="9" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; fill: black; font-weight: bold;">Mr. John Kay, formerly President of the National Association  of Head Teachers, is of opinion that " There does not appear  to be a large place for the cinema in primary school work. In  the essentials of instruction it can be of no service. As an in-  teresting and attractive aid, purely illustrative, to the teaching  of a small group of subjects — industrial geography, travel, con-  temporary history, natural history and the like — there is a small  field for it. Used in conjunction with lecture and letterpress it  can give much colour to fact and terminology, but the cost would  have to be small to justify its employment." ^ </tspan></text><text x="9" y="226.73820224719" text-anchor="start"><tspan alignment-baseline="middle" x="9" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; fill: black; font-weight: bold;">Mr. J. W. BuNN, member of the Executive of the National  Union of Teachers, states : " I do not think that there is any  ^educational value in the films worth mentioning at present. Some  houses, in deference to the clamour for improving the mind,  put in films showing manufacturing processes and natural phe-  inomena, but I believe these only bore the audience and are  tolerated in silence until the real entertainment commences  again. I think that in poor neighbourhoods where the children  need more change and variety in school work than among the  I well-to-do, it would not be a bad plan to have a cinematograph  ^lesson once a week. It could be done by arranging for children  [from three or four schools to go for an hour to a suitable  cinerna, and the education authority could pay proprietors a  penny per head, exactly as they do now for visits to the baths.  I should arrange for the programme to be selected by the  teachers, and for one of the teachers to explain the films in a  few suitable words as the exhibition proceeded. The film pro-  prietors have hundreds of beautiful films illustrating mountain,  river and forest scenery, the manufacture of common articles,  etc., which they are ready to loan at any time, and there will be  no difficulty in getting the managers of local halls to admit school  children during school hours at a penny each." ^ </tspan></text><text x="9" y="231.776404494381" text-anchor="start"><tspan alignment-baseline="middle" x="9" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; fill: black; font-weight: bold;">Mr. Grant Ramsay, Principal of the Institute of Hygiene,  who has given much attention to the educational value of the  cinema, says — </tspan></text><text x="9" y="236.81460674157202" text-anchor="start"><tspan alignment-baseline="middle" x="9" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; fill: black; font-weight: bold;">Mr. A.

Well, it is largely a, matter of personal  history. The films were being made in this country, and I was  making^a number of films in this country about eighteen or  nineteen years ago. </tspan></text><text x="9" y="262.00561797752715" text-anchor="start"><tspan alignment-baseline="middle" x="9" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; fill: black; font-weight: bold;">Mr. Hepworth. Well, from that point the Americans have  realised the possibilities of this cinematograph from the com-  mercial point of view more clearly than the English people have.  There has not been that support of the English manufacturers ;  it has been hard to obtain capital to develop the picture industry  in the way it should be developed. The money that was available  for the cinematograph progress was put into the theatres for many  years, and it cannot be denied that for many years the theatres of  this country were infinitely better than the theatres in America. </tspan></text><text x="9" y="267.0438202247182" text-anchor="start"><tspan alignment-baseline="middle" x="9" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; fill: black; font-weight: bold;">Mr. Lamert.

Some time ago the British manufacturers  attended as a deputation before the Customs to go into this  question of taxation. Unfortunately the Treasury saw the  Americans first, and I think it would be interesting to ask Mr.  Hepworth if he will give some particulars as to what the official  attitude was towards the British manufacturers. </tspan></text><text x="9" y="282.1584269662914" text-anchor="start"><tspan alignment-baseline="middle" x="9" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; fill: black; font-weight: bold;">Mr. Lamert.
